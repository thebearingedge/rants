There are a lot of success stories floating around about how #networking helps people break into #softwaredevelopment

Two points on this.

1. It's true.
2. There are almost no excuses for not getting involved.

100% of my job offers in the last 6 years have started with networking. I didn't consciously follow a step process, but I have seen my experience repeated with others time and again.

First, I think software is cool. Technology is interesting and the possibilities are inspiring. Being able to solve a "real" problem with tech is incredibly satisfying. By "real" I mean a problem that _you_ can perceive, understand, and _want_ fixed, no matter how small.

Admittedly, it's easy to create over-complicated or naive solutions. Take comfort in the fact that even very "successful" engineers fall into these traps. Occasionally as part of a calculated risk; often just straight-up by mistake and the mess has to get cleaned up somehow (maybe? sometimes it doesn't even matter). So here's my next point.

Curb your #impostersyndrome. People screw things up _constantly_. It's a part of being human. Nobody's perfect and there'll always be somebody better than you at something(s). Here's the upshot. You are trying, which is more than can be said for a huuuuuuge number of people in _most_ fields. Be sure to look up what imposter syndrome actually is. If you prioritize honing your skills and making an impact (subconsciously or otherwise), then imposter syndrome almost inevitable. But if you _don't_ prioritize these things, then you _don't_ have imposter syndrome. It's called "guilt".

So how do you get involved?

Share what you know. Don't bother yourself with the quantity. Focus on quality.

- attend meetups that look even remotely educational
- ask questions that you genuinely want answers to
- find a meetup directly or tangentially related to what you are interested in or are pursuing in your **free time** (we're trying, remember?)
- prepare a presentation (like _actually_ prepare)
    - write an outline
    - make an ultra-simple slide deck
    - revise the deck until there are as few words as possible on it, so you can do the talking
    - scope it to as short as you want (lightning talks are a thing)
    - make a _tiny_ demo
- offer to speak at some meetups. Organizers want speakers. Always.

If you even remotely have your shit together, you will have fun (or as in my case, be relieved that nobody shot you from the audience). You will probably impress some of the attendees. Maybe not with your content (that's not the point, though it does happen), but at least with your willingness to put yourself out there something that leaders will notice in you _instantly_. Again, not everyone is "trying" like you are.

I want to wrap this up so here's one more point. You need to **be curious about what people are up to**. Take an active interest and ask them. It may or may not feel awkward to ask, and some people are pricks and respond poorly to people nervously approaching them. But only very few people are like that, so fuck them anyway (pro tip: don't tell them "fuck you"). Most everybody is really appreciative of being asked for their input, perspective, or otherwise being made to feel "looked up to". Just be genuine and humble, so people don't get the sense that you have some bullshit agenda.
