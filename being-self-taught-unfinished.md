I'm self-taught and have been building stuff for nearly ten years. I've been a (lead) bootcamp instructor for nearly half of that time. I've got some experience and a unique perspective that may be useful to others.




First, you can absolutely teach yourself.




I had actually wanted to get into coding when I was a kid but it wasn't until my mid-late 20s that I finally realized I could do whatever I wanted, including learning anything I wanted.  I wasn't learning in order to enter the workforce and I didn't even know boot camps existed. I was doing it because I believed (albeit naively) that writing my own software was giving me a competitive advantage in my field of eCommerce at the time. It was organic. I think my situation was special in this regard and differs from most people trying to "break into tech". I didn't want to break in, I wanted super powers. It just so happened that I developed a deep passion for writing software.




I was mostly "hacking" things together for the first 1-2 years of my time as a programmer. I got lucky because I had an ok intuition for it and a flexible schedule, due to being self-employed with no family or mortgage. I was ok to sleep on the couch at my recording studio. Most of the things I built for that first bit took an INSANELY long time to get working: stuff that would take me about 30 minutes took DAYS back then. But I had the will (and hubris) to push through. It didn't matter that it was hard or that my code was pretty trash.




There was an inflection point at around the 12-18 month mark where I was getting tired of "hacking things together". It was just taking too much time to get anything done. The simple joy of the activity was becoming overshadowed by my frustration with my inability to get solutions working in a predictable fashion. Now, at this point I already had experience as a musician. I already knew what practice was, and I knew what it felt like to gain skill. So I literally googled "How to learn JavaScript properly". Lo and behold. Someone wrote a roadmap. I committed to doing it. It has you read books and build projects, all the while reminding you that you are still a noob and not to get ahead of yourself. My skills doubled or tripled in three months time.




After a couple more years I was getting heavily involved in my local meetup scene while still writing projects for work and practicing in my free time. Again, mind you, I was not employed by anyone to write software. But I was attending meetups and even giving presentations at them. People asked me where I worked and didn't seem to know how to react when I told them that I ran my own business. My new network of developer friends started inquiring about my availability for work. This happened over the course of a few years coming from no formal background and no programming as a kid or anything like that.




I actually ended up going the teaching route. Most companies don't actually do anything I value, and I'm passionate about the subject matter. Outside of a brief stint at an agency (which I hated doing), I have only ever written code for the business I co-owned and for custom software at the boot camps that I've taught at. I also had prior experience with teaching music, so teaching people how to code is the perfect job for me.




Ok, so that's the self-taught route I went, glossing over lots of details, obviously. I've come to the conclusion that not everybody can go the self-taught route in less than a few years.




Bear in mind that you can definitely qualify for "a job" way sooner and with way less work than what I'm proposing. You'll make modest money and probably do shit work unless you end up at a rare company with good junior roles. Don't forget that there are so many people trying to get in, that there is almost certainly someone better than you that is willing to do the shit work for the modest pay. I'm just talking about what I think it takes to be "good" or "competitive" in short order.




1. On average, you must cut out all other non-essential activities in order to focus. This is because the average person is not intelligent enough to learn a complex skill "in their free time". Some people hate me for saying this, but your learning speed dictates your rate of progress. Everything else is your life getting in the way, including possibly your parents and siblings. There's no two ways about it. If you are exceedingly intelligent, then stop reading and start doing. Your main problem is that you're lazy and haven't learned to take control of your life yet.




2. On average, you must stop spending as much time with your friends. This is because the average person's friends (especially teens and 20s) are not driven and mostly waste time and brain cells on trivial things.




3. On average, you must plan on it taking "forever". This is because the average person cannot go hard, 12 -16 hours per day for months on end. You will burn out or literally hurt yourself. Lifelong skills are practiced lifelong. You'll need breaks.




4. On average, you must love it so much, that it becomes one of your primary hobbies. This is because it's hard as fuck and most people don't hate themselves so much that they'll suffer through the tough points and tolerate feeling like a complete moron most of the time.
